# Project: Simple To-Do List Application

## Description:

Create a simple command-line to-do list application. Users should be able to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view their to-do list.

# Features:

## Task Management:

Allow users to add tasks to their to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed.

## Task Categories:

Optional: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping).

## View To-Do List:

Display the current to-do list with tasks and their completion status.
Optionally, display tasks based on categories.

## Task Deletion:

Allow users to remove tasks from the to-do list.

## Data Storage:

Store the to-do list data in a file (e.g., using JSON) to persist tasks between program executions.

## Skills Practiced:

User input handling.
File I/O for data persistence.
Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries) for task management.
Conditional statements for task completion status.
Looping for displaying the to-do list.
